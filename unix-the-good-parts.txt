* Threads
  On Linux/glibc, they're fast and useful.

* File descriptors
  A nice abstraction, especially when used in combination with
  a mainloop such as GLib's.

* mmap
  An efficient way to share memory across multiple processes, very useful.

* That's it!
  Everything else varies from "OK" (mounts, processes) to "garbage" (signals, fork(), /etc)
