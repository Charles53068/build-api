* Threads
  On Linux/glibc, they're fast and useful.

* File descriptors
  A nice abstraction, especially when used in combination with
  a mainloop such as GLib's.

* mmap
  An efficient way to share memory across multiple processes, very useful.

* binfmt, or the idea that an executable can be found by magic in a file header;
  essentially being agnostic to what defines an executable.

* Hard links for files
  These help implement efficient specialized filesystems in userspace,
  like hacktree and git.
