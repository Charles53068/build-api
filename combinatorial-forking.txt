General Purpose Linux combinatorial forking

In http://people.gnome.org/~walters/distributions.txt I outline the
logic behind "General Purpose Linux fork".  What the *real* problem is
is not that there are say 3-4 "big" ones fighting for usage, it's that
inside each of these, there are often multiple choices (desktop
environment, filesystem layout, sound system, init system), which all
influence how things work.

Multiply this by the fact that they release at different schedules
with different versions of components (which may have different bugs),
in turn multiplied by things like available architectures (32 vs 64
bit).

Finally, multiply the above by any minor different "spins" and
derivatives that may exist of each one.

This is *combinatorial* forking, and is insane and unsustainable.
