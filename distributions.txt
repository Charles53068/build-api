"Linux distribution" is a bad term, because it encompasses several
types of derived system which really have different qualities.  I use
these terms:

General Purpose Linux fork:
  Multiuser, all purpose operating systems, often combined with a
  large set of additional software in one big "package" set.  There
  is usually no defined stability of the system; it devolves to "whatever
  upstream does".  So gtk+ and X11 are stable, most everything else is not.

  Why do I explicitly say "fork" here?  Well, you see "Arch Linux"
  randomly decided that /usr/bin/python is Python 3 one day, and I had
  enough.  But long before that, there are fundamental things like how
  shared libraries work (think multilib or /lib64) that *really
  matter* and are actually different.

  Examples: Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, Mandriva, etc. etc...

OS (Linux based):
  An operating system which uses Linux as a kernel and possibly
  parts of userland that's in use from the GP Linux forks.  Stability
  of the base system is "strict", or at least with well defined strict
  parts.  Another key distinction is these systems do not claim to be
  general purpose, for example, they often target personal
  devices, omitting multiuser support.

  Examples: MeeGo, Android

embeds:
  Custom systems basically designed to run one application.
  Distinct from the first two as there is no application API.
  Most often generated by tools such as Yocto (however, note 
  that Yocto can also create operating systems too)
